# A Virtual Expedition to the Juneau Icefield

This curriculum was developed by Arianna Varuolo-Clarke and Allie Balter-Kennedy as part of the two-week, virtual 2021 Summer Academy hosted by the Washington State University Upward Bound program. 

We delivered the course in two one-week segments and students were able to take one or both weeks. Therefore, activities from either week can stand alone or be used in sequence. The Syllabus for each week describes the breakdown of the course, and all lectures, homeworks and activity resources are provided. 

Documents provided in the .zip file on this GitHub repo are in Microsoft Office formats. This course was originally hosted in Google Drive so that students could easily collaborate in the same document, so we recommend using this in Google Drive if possible. A [Google Drive version of the course is available here]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QY8tYyHddSGzoEAyU5GwcshcwYHZTMGw?usp=sharing)), but may not be available indefinitely. 

Please reach out to Arianna Varuolo-Clarke (avclarke@ucar.edu) and/or Allie Balter-Kennedy (abalter@ldeo.columbia.edu) if you are having trouble accessing these resources or have any questions! We'd also love to hear about how you are using any or all of these resources - we created them to be shared and hope that you are able to bring the Juneau Icefield to your own classroom!
